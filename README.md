## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Voice-to-Ticket Feature Issues

**Current Status:** Voice recording interface is implemented but may not function properly in all environments.

**Known Problems:**
- **Browser Compatibility**: Voice recording requires modern browser with WebRTC support
- **HTTPS Requirement**: Microphone access requires HTTPS in production (works on localhost)
- **Permission Blocking**: Users may deny microphone permissions
- **Audio Format Support**: Different browsers support different audio formats (WebM, WAV, etc.)
- **OpenAI API Dependency**: Transcription requires valid OpenAI API key and credits

**Workarounds Available:**
- **Demo Mode**: Use the "Demo Mode" button to test with sample audio
- **DummyAI Fallback**: Set `USE_TRANSCRIPTION=false` to disable voice features
- **Manual Text Entry**: All incident creation can be done via text input
- **Development Testing**: Works reliably on `localhost` during development

**Production Deployment Considerations:**
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled for microphone access
- Configure proper CORS headers for audio upload
- Monitor OpenAI API usage and rate limits
- Consider implementing audio format conversion for browser compatibility

### Other Limitations

**Risk Map Simulator:**
- **Demo Data Only**: Currently uses seeded mock data for Philadelphia area
- **Real-time Updates**: Risk calculations are static, not connected to live utility systems
- **Limited Geography**: Focused on single metro area (expandable with real data)

**AI Analysis:**
- **API Key Required**: Full AI features require OpenAI API access
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API has usage limits that may affect high-volume usage
- **Response Quality**: DummyAI fallback provides basic responses, not intelligent analysis

**Authentication:**
- **Basic Session Management**: Currently uses simple session handling
- **No Role-based Access**: All users have same permissions
- **Single Tenant**: Not configured for multi-company usage

### Development vs Production Gaps

**Environment Dependencies:**
```bash
# Required for full functionality
OPENAI_API_KEY=required_for_ai_features
DATABASE_URL=required_for_persistence
USE_OPENAI=true (for intelligent analysis)
USE_TRANSCRIPTION=true (for voice features)
```

**Recommended Setup for Production:**
1. **HTTPS Deployment**: Essential for voice features
2. **Database Scaling**: Configure connection pooling for high load
3. **API Monitoring**: Set up OpenAI usage tracking
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive logging
5. **Security Hardening**: Add rate limiting and input validation

### Future Fixes Planned

**Voice Feature Improvements:**
- Cross-browser audio format standardization
- Offline voice processing capabilities
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Alternative input methods for accessibility

**Production Readiness:**
- Real-time data connectors for utility systems
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Advanced authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
